==============

Real-time page change tracking service built using Meteor.

In essence, you can start watching URLs for changes and see a diff of that data over time.
This was especially useful on a consulting engagement to track CMS changes across international market launches and make changes from the master language to translated sites.

Make sure to change server/lib/email.js configs.
